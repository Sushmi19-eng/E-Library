            Entrepreneurs have a problem: startups. Almost all startups either fail or never truly reach a sustainable size. Despite the popularity of entrepreneurship, we haven't engineered a better way to start...until now.
What if you could skip the startup phase and generate profitable revenue on day one?
In BUY THEN BUILD, acquisition entrepreneur Walker Deibel shows you how to begin with a sustainable, profitable company and grow from there. You'll learn how to:
Buy an existing company rather than starting from scratch
Use ownership as a path to financial independence
Spend a fraction of the time raising capital
Find great brokers, generate your own "deal flow," and see new listings early
Uncover the best opportunities and biggest risks of any company
Navigate the acquisition process
Become a successful acquisition entrepreneur
And more
